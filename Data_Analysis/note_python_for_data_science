Basic Steps in a Data Science Project
	Acquire
		import raw dataset into your analytics platform
			Identify data sets
			Retrieve data
			Query data

	Prepare
		explore & visulize
			Understand nature of data
			preliminary analysis

		pre-process data
			Clean
				inconsistent values
				duplicate records
				missing values
				invalid data
				outliers

				remove data with missing values
				merge duplicate records
				generate best estimate for invalid values
					
			transform
				integrate
				package

	Analyze
		feature selection
		model selection
			- category
			- regression
			- clustering
			- association analysis
			- graph analytics: use graph structures to find connections between entities
			- modeling: build model -> validate model

		analyze the results

	report
		present your findings

	act

Data Collection from Diverse Sources
	Databases
		relational
		non-relational(NoSQL)
	Text files
		CSV files

20190523 Introduction to Machine Learning
modles/system can learn to perform a specific task on its own

application:
	creadit card fraud detection
	handwritten digit recognition
	recommendations on websites

categories of machine learning
	classfication
	cluster analysis
	regression
	association analysis

supervised approaches
	target is provided
	labled data
	classfication & regression are supervised

unsupervised approaches
	target is unknown or unavailable
	unlabled data
	cluster analysis & association analysis are unsupervised
